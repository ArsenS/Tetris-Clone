Tetris clone made in Unity Engine
---------------------------------

Simple game project made to familiarize myself with the basics of Unity Engine and C#.

To run, install Unity Engine and load the project. Then load the "Tetris Clone.unity" scene file from the Tetris-Clone-master/Assets/Scenes folder.
